review - when clicking a review, a review id is appended to the url. this view pulls up the entire review, subdividied into tabs
add - this view opens when you click add a review for a given software. shows a form that submits to firebase.
search - although incomplete, this view will be able to search through reviews and filter/sort the results based on certain criteria such as software title, date of the review, by tag, and by reviewer name.

Finally, there is a constant portion on top of every view for navigating home, to my work's website, and the search functionality.
